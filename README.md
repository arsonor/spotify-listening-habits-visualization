# Spotify new markets listening habits visualization

## Overview

This project aims to analyze Spotify streaming data, focusing on emerging markets and their music consumption patterns. Using data from various regions over the last three years, the goal is to provide insights into the evolving music trends in these countries and visualize the findings using Power BI.

## Context and Project Structure

The project follows the process from data acquisition to modeling and visualization, as described below:

### 1. Data Scraping
- **Source**: The primary data comes from [Spotify's charts](https://charts.spotify.com/charts/view/regional-global-weekly/latest).
  - Weekly ranking (top 200) songs by number of streams (1 stream = minimum 30s of listening)
  - Categorized by users from a specific country (more than 70) and globally (on users worldwide).

  **Choice of study framework:**

  For the scope of this project and considering the deadline, I've decided to limit the data according to:
  - 15 countries + Global
    - USA
    - Europe (France, Turkey)
    - Africa (Nigeria, Egypt)
    - Asia (Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan)
    - Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina)

  - over the last 3 years (**156** weeks until 02/22/2024)

- **Web Scraping**: A Python script was used to scrape the Spotify charts data.

  You can read the code in the following notebook: [`01_charts_scrapping.ipynb`](code/01_charts_scrapping.ipynb)

- **API Integration**: Additional track and artist information were retrieved using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), requiring valid API credentials and access tokens.

  The code is in this notebook: [`02_api_spotify.ipynb`](code/02_api_spotify.ipynb)

### 2. Data Handling
- **Collected Files**: The raw data is stored in CSV files:
  - `charts.csv`: Contains data from the web scraped charts.
  Here a description of the main attibutes collected for a weekly song:
    - **trackName**, **track_ID**, its **image** and **releaseDate**, the **artist** (only the main one) and **artist_ID**
    - **Rank**: ranking in the chart (1 to 200)
    - **PeakRank**: highest ranking reached for this track
    - **PeakDate**: date on which this peak is reached for the first time
    - **WeeksOnChart**: Total weeks of presence in the chart
    - **Streak**: Total consecutive weeks (if equal to WeeksOnChart, the track has never left the charts)
    - **Streams**: target value to aggregate
    - **Trend**: 'moved up', 'moved down', 'no change', 'new entry', 're-entry'
    - **entryRank**: rank at first entry in the chart
    - **entryDate**: date of its first entry
    - **Week**: date of the corresponding week of the chart

  - `tracks.csv`: Holds for each track ID, the track metadata such as track name, release date, and features like:
    - the **external_url** so we can access to spotify and hear the song after clicking on it
    - 5 descriptors: **duration_ms**, **tempo**, **key**, **mode**, **time signature**
    - 4 confidence measures: **acousticness**, **liveness**, **speechiness**, **instrumentalness**
    - 4 perceptual measures: **energy**, **loudness**, **danceability**, **valence**

     You will find the meaning of all these parameters in the [API documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features)

  - `artists.csv` & `genres.csv`: Include for each artist ID for further enrichment, its **popularity** and **followers** and **genre** of the music (as strange and inconvenient as it may seem, in Spotify, the genre is attached to the artist and not the track).
  
- **Data Cleaning**: The scraped data underwent a cleaning process to remove duplicates, rename columns, and ensure uniformity across different files.

### 3. Data Modeling
You can read the code in the following notebook: [`03_data_modeling.ipynb`](code/03_data_modeling.ipynb)

- **Fact and Dimension Tables**: The project follows a star schema approach:
  - **Fact Table (FACT_CHART)**: Consolidates all `charts.csv` data across 15 countries and global charts for three years. Each row represents a trackâ€™s rank for a specific country and week.
  - **Dimension Tables**:
    - `DIM_Track`: Consolidates track data from `tracks.csv` and links with the fact table to retrieve track names and release dates.
    - `DIM_Artist` and `DIM_Genre`: Created by merging artist and genre information with the fact table.
    - `DIM_Region`: Adds regional identifiers to the fact table for easier analysis across different countries.

Here the final Star schema in Power BI:

### 4. EDA

A first analysis of the datas is done in this notebook: [`04_first_analysis.ipynb`](code/04_first_analysis.ipynb)


### 5. Data Visualization
- **Power BI Dashboard**: 
See pictures above
  - Visualizes key metrics such as the number of streams, top-performing artists, and weekly chart movements across different regions.
  - Includes filters by region, time period, artist, and genre to allow in-depth analysis.
  - Highlights trends in music consumption in countries like Nigeria, Indonesia, Brazil, and more.
  
  Key insights include:
  - Growth in streams across emerging markets.
  - Popularity of genres like pop, reggaeton, hip hop, and regional styles.
  - Detailed artist performance, tracking streams and chart positions over time.

- **Data Analysis**:
  

### 6. Limitations
- The data focuses on mainstream tracks and does not fully represent the diversity of music within each region.
- User-specific data (such as demographic information or user behavior) was not accessible for this study.
  
### 7. Future Work
- Extending the dataset to cover up to 10 years of streaming data for historical trend analysis.
- Implementing an ETL pipeline using SSIS to automate weekly data updates in Power BI.

## Conclusion
This project presents an insightful analysis of global and regional music trends using Spotify data. The findings help understand the growth and popularity of music genres across various emerging markets, visualized effectively through Power BI.
